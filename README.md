Customer analytics with data aggregation, Key Performance Indicators,  A/B Testing.


<p>
Customer analytics is a process by which data from customer behavior is used to help make key business decisions via market segmentation and predictive analytics. This information is used by businesses for direct marketing, site selection, and customer relationship management. Marketing provides services in order to satisfy customers. With that in mind, the productive system is considered from its beginning at the production level, to the end of the cycle at the consumer. Customer analytics plays an important role in the prediction of customer behavior.

<p>
In this project data is used to observe customer behavior, understand it over time periods,
develop Key Performance Indicators and conduct A/B Testing. The techniques applied here are
allowed to make proactive, data-driven business decisions, which generate customer value and financial
profit.
